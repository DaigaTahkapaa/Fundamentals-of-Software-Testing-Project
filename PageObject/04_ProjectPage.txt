### **Project functionality Testsuite (TS-4)**

*** Settings ***

Documentation	Testing the Project CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. 
				Covers creating blank projects and projects from templates, viewing project details, updating project settings, and deleting projects (including restore and permanent deletion from Inactive tab). 
				Note on test approach: Some actions (e.g., rename, delete) are available via quick actions on the project card (Actions menu with ellipsis button), but these tests navigate through opening the project and accessing Settings from the left sidebar.
				Scope Limitations:
				- Import project and CI/CD for external repository options are excluded
				- Template selection: Only "Sample GitLab Project" template is tested from the built-in templates
				- Deployment Target: Only "No deployment planned" is tested
				- Visibility Level: Only "Private" is tested
				- Project Configuration: "Initialize repository with a README" is checked (default), SAST and Secret Detection excluded
				- Experimental settings (SHA-256): Excluded
				- Project archiving: Excluded

Pre Condition	Internet connection is active
				User has a valid registered account
				Browser is open in incognito/private mode 
				Navigate to https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in
				Successfully sign in with valid credentials
				Confirm user is on GitLab Home page (page title: "Home · GitLab")

Post Condition	Delete any test projects created during testing
				Ensure user is logged out
				Close incognito browser window
